# Testing javascript is ready.

First step, insert the attribute class in the <html> tag with the value "no-js".
If the javascript is not ready or does not work, the class will remain "no-js". When javascrit is ready or activated, the script changes from "no-js" to "js"

## This script does not contain any dependencies
